I've recently taken a job at [Ansible](http://ansible.com) working on the enterprise offering Tower. In case you don't know, Tower is a front-end for your Ansible playbooks w/ enterprise permission management. I was tasked with evaluating our database needs for a new System Tracking feature that we released. Working remotely at the time forced me to create detailed presentations on my progress and evaluation. I ended up taking the internal presentations and created a blog post about the evaluation process.
