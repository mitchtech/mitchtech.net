Simplest possible digital input with the ADK.  This article will discuss the bare minimal requirements for development of a basic USB digital input accessory.  The goal is to demonstrate the easiest possible use of the technology.  For additional background information on Android development, Arduino, and MicroBridge, check out these links:

[Android Developer’s Guide](http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html)

[Getting Started with Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)

[Microbridge](http://code.google.com/p/microbridge/)

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have setup the development environments for Arduino and Android:

[Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

[Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

## Hardware

#### Parts needed:

  * Android Device (1.6+)

  * 2x Push button

  * Hook-up wire

  * Android ADK Board*

  * – OR –

  * Arduino compatible and USB Host shield

*Supported boards include:

[Google ADK board](http://www.rt-net.jp/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=3_4&products_id=1), [Freeduino ADK board ](http://shop.moderndevice.com/products/freeduino-usb-host-board), [Seeed Studio ADK board](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/seeeduino-adk-main-board-p-846.html), and [DIY Drones ADK board](https://store.diydrones.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=BR-PhoneDrone)

#### Assembly

Connect one side of each button to ground and the other side to digital pins 2 and 3 respectively.  Here is a diagram of the completed circuit (created with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/)):

## Software

#### Arduino Firmware

Next, upload the Arduino sketch to the microcontroller. The sketch uses the [Microbridge ](http://code.google.com/p/microbridge/)implementation by Niels Brouwers. Microbridge uses Android Debug Bridge (ABD) forwarding over TCP, rather than the [Google Android ADK](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/adk.html). You can checkout the source for the Arduino sketch from Github, or just copy and paste the following into the Arduino IDE.

#### Android App

The next step is to install the Android Demo application onto the device. You can either [download the pre-built .apk](http://mitch-tech.appspot.com/adb/AdbSimpleDigitalInput.apk) or checkout the source from [Github](https://github.com/mitchtech/android_adb_simple_digital_input):

```
git clone git://github.com/mitchtech/android_adb_simple_digital_input.git
```

Finally upload the app to the device (or browse to this page on the device and download the apk above).  Connect the Android device to the USB Host board/shield, and start up the app.
