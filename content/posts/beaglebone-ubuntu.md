We can install Ubuntu 2-ways:

  1. To the external SDCARD
  2. To the internal MMC

Installing to the internal MMC requires an SDCARD to install, but the sdcard is not required after that. The process is mostly the same. The MMC setup vs. the SDCARD setup depends on which image you download.

## Installing Ubuntu

  * **MMC:** [Download](http://rcn-ee.net/deb/flasher/raring/) the latest file of the form _BBB-eMMC-flasher-ubuntu-xx.xx-xxxx-xx-xx.img.xz_

  * **SDCARD:** [Download](http://rcn-ee.net/deb/rootfs/quantal/) the latest file of the form _ubuntu-12.10-console-armhf-xxxx-xx-xx.tar.xz_

Extract the image

```
sudo apt-get install xz
xz -d *.img.xz
```

Insert the sdcard into your desktop and note the device path. In my case the device is at _/dev/sdc_.

```

```

Flash the image to the sdcard. Substitute _<mmc_or_sdcard>.img_ and _/dev/sdX_ accordingly.

```
sudo dd if=<mmc_or_sdcard>.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```

Upon completion remove the sdcard and perform the following:

  * Ensure the beaglebone is off

  * If you plan on powering the beaglebone with usb, ensure the ethernet is unplugged.

  * Insert the sdcard into the beaglebone

  * Hold down the button that is by itself near the SDCARD

  * Insert the USB power or barrel jack power

  * Once the lights begin blinking blue you may release the button

  * Wait =~ 45 minutes until all the lights are blueÂ 

Once all the lights turn solid blue the MMC is successfully flashed and you may power down your beaglebone (unplug the power), remove the sdcard. Wait a couple seconds, then plug the power back in and the system will boot Ubuntu.

### Verifying Ubuntu Install

Find the ip of your beaglebone on your network.

```

ssh to your beaglebone.

```
ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.116
ubuntu@192.168.1.116's password: temppwd
